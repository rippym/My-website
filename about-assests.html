        <p> I like to draw, I like to practice martial arts, I love creating comics and working on my manga ideas. I tend to study coloring styles from other artists like Wada Sachiko or Meka or other well known japanese artists</p>

<p>With Mekas style I love how she puts more emphasis on the perspective of the fighter and how much she pushes the law of anatomy</p>

        <p> along with how much she knows about human anatomy, she really shows us just how talented she is</p>
